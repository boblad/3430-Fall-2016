Question 1:

The probability of a Binary search Tree being a list as the number of nodes goes to infinity gets
closer and closer to zero. After about 10 nodes the probability is less than 1%


Question 2

The probability of a Binary search Tree being a balanced follows the same model
of how a list acts as it approaches infinite nodes. The balance of a BST with more
nodes approaches 0.
