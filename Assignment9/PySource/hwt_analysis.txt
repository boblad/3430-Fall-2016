The semi-weekly river flow, (in cubic feet per second) at the US Geological Survey Data Station
1242400 on Hangman Creek, from December 1992 to January 1993. All measurements are approximate and rounded to
2 places after the decimal point. The average river flow is 17.69 cubic feet per second
From December to January the flow increase by 16.46 cubic feet per second
From the 1st half of December to the 2nd half of December the flow decreased by approximately 16
cubic feet per second.

The results from the first to second half December showed a depth increase of 1.6cm.
The results from the first to second half January showed a depth increase of 24cm,
The last data entry severely effected the results.

The first - second quarter of December resulted in a depth decrease of 1.5cm.
The third - fourth quarter of December resulted in a depth increase of .25cm.
The first - second quarter of January resulted in a depth decrease of 3.5cm.
The third - fourth quarter of January resulted in a depth increase of 61cm.

Again, The last data value hugely effected the balance of the month.
